# Notes for cleaning script

# Cleaning to complete on domestic_tourism
# - janitor on names
# - drop 'measurement' column
# - drop 'featurecode' column
# - split into 3 sets? pounds, visits and nights?
#   - mutate DateCode to specify individual years

# Cleaning of activities
# - janitor on names
# - drop 'featurecode'
# - drop measurement
# - figure out how to group / sort this (the question is which type generates the most visits?)
